# Roo AI Development Cycle - Project Starter Kit

Welcome! This collection of documents is designed to help you and your Roo AI agent kickstart new application development projects using a structured, interactive, and reliable workflow.

This process, detailed in [`Roo_AI_Coding_Workflow.md`](./Roo_AI_Coding_Workflow.md), is based on the idea that building software with an AI is a conversation, not a single command. By breaking the process into phases, you provide the AI with the context it needs to deliver high-quality results while keeping you in full control.

## Files in this Kit

1.  **`Roo_AI_Coding_Workflow.md`**:
    *   **Purpose**: This is the primary document outlining the 3-phase interactive development cycle: PRD Conversation, Task Breakdown, and Iterative Implementation.
    *   **Usage**: Refer to this for the overall process and the specific prompts to use at each stage of your conversation with the Roo agent.

2.  **`project_brief_template.md`**:
    *   **Purpose**: A simplified, fillable template for your initial feature idea.
    *   **Usage**: Copy this file, rename it for your feature (e.g., `brief-user-profile.md`), and fill it out. This completed brief is the starting point for "Phase 1: PRD Conversation."

3.  **`example_project_brief_generic_app.md`**:
    *   **Purpose**: A concrete example of how the `project_brief_template.md` can be filled out for a hypothetical "Smart Task Manager" application.
    *   **Usage**: Use this as a reference to understand the level of detail needed for your initial brief.

4.  **`architectural_outputs_checklist.md`**:
    *   **Purpose**: A checklist to verify the outputs of "Phase 1: PRD Conversation" and "Phase 2: Task Breakdown."
    *   **Usage**: After the Roo agent generates the PRD and the task list, use this checklist to ensure all necessary components have been created before you begin coding.

5.  **`Roo_Workflow_Overview.md`**:
    *   **Purpose**: A high-level, one-page summary of the entire development cycle.
    *   **Usage**: A quick reference to understand the flow without diving into the detailed prompts.

## Suggested Workflow

1.  **Understand the Process**: Familiarize yourself with the overall process by reading [`Roo_AI_Coding_Workflow.md`](./Roo_AI_Coding_Workflow.md).
2.  **Define Your Feature**:
    *   Copy `project_brief_template.md` to a new file (e.g., `brief-[your_feature_name].md`).
    *   Fill in the template with your feature idea.
3.  **Start the Conversation**:
    *   Begin "Phase 1: PRD Conversation" with your Roo agent, using your completed brief as the starting point. Follow the prompts in the workflow guide.
4.  **Review and Proceed**:
    *   Use the `architectural_outputs_checklist.md` to verify the PRD and task list.
    *   Continue with "Phase 3: Iterative Implementation" to build your feature, one step at a time.

This starter kit aims to streamline your development process, ensuring a thorough and well-considered approach to building software with your Roo AI agent.
